Yay!! While growing up, figuring out happiness has been tough for me.\nSo, What is Happiness? Well, I think happiness is feeling good without needing anything else. It\u0026rsquo;s like when you\u0026rsquo;re content with what you have. Wanting stuff all the time actually makes us unhappy. You know, like always wishing for this or that. The further away we are from getting what we want, the more unhappy we feel.\nBut does that mean we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t want anything at all? I\u0026rsquo;d say no. It\u0026rsquo;s totally fine to want things. But the key is to enjoy the journey of trying to get them. Because most of the time, we\u0026rsquo;re working towards our goals.\nThis way of thinking has really helped me out, and I hope it helps you too.\n","date":"29 August 2022","permalink":"/2022/08/happiness/","section":"Blog Posts","summary":"Finally, after putting it off for ages, I\u0026rsquo;m getting my thoughts down.","title":"Happiness"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/topics/personal/","section":"","summary":"","title":"Personal"},{"content":"Good Day Fellas, I am sourabh\nI always wanted to have a personal space online. This desire led me to create multiple blogs but I failed as my motivation to start was different back then. Recently I came across an awesome article about \u0026ldquo;the great online game” by Packy McCormick that explains how we all are part of an online game.\nWith this shift in perspective I decided to be a part of the great online game and created this website. This website is a way for me to share some of my thoughts, ideas and stories and projects.\nI currently work as as a Software Engineer at Qualcomm, Hyderabad.\nMy Hobbies and Interests\nI love games and tinker with code from time-to-time. Here’s an interesting fact about me. I get bored really fast which is why I cycle through things I am interested in but I mostly end up picking two three things at a time. Yeah I am kinda messed up.\nThese days I am learning to be a better reader and writer and solve coding problems for kick (green ticks).\nApart from things mentioned above I love to read. This is a newly found hobby because I was never a reader. I read anything that I find interesting. I am currently reading Sapiens by Yuah noval harari.\nThanks for stopping by. Have a good day.

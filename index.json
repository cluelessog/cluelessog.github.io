[{"content":"After months of procrastination, here comes the first brain dump. Happiness!!\nGrowing up this is something I have struggled with.\nWhat is Happiness? Happiness is a default state. You are happy when you don’t have anything missing in your life. The desire for external things makes us feel unhappy. I want this and I want that. The farther you are from that desire, the bigger the feeling of discontentment.\nDoes that mean you shouldn’t have desires at all? I would say No. It is okay to have desires as long as you are enjoying the process that helps you in achieving the desired object because most of your time will be spent on the process.\nI have immensely benefited from this perspective. I hope this helps you as well.\n","date":"29 August 2022","permalink":"/2022/08/happiness/","section":"Blog Posts","summary":"After months of procrastination, here comes the first brain dump.","title":"Happiness"}]

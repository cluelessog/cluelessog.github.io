Good Day **Fellas**, I am **sourabh**

I've always wanted my own space on the internet. I've tried making blogs before, but they never really worked out because I didn't have the right reasons for starting them. Recently, though, I read this cool article by **Packy McCormick** that talked about how we're all part of "[the great online game](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game?s=r)" It got me thinking differently.

So, I decided to join in "the great online game" and made this website. Here, I want to share my thoughts, ideas, stories, and projects with you.

I currently work as as a **Virtual Prototyping Engineer** at **Synopsys, Noida**.

**My Hobbies and Interests**

In my free time, I like playing games and messing around with [coding projects](https://github.com/cluelessog). Fun fact about me: I tend to get bored easily and jump between different interests, but I usually stick with a couple at a time.

Lately, I've been trying to get better at reading and writing, and I've been doing coding challenges for fun.

Besides all the tech stuff, I've also started enjoying reading books. Right now, I'm reading "Sapiens" by Yuval Noah Harari.

Thanks for stopping by. Have a good day. Feel free to [connect](https://linkedin.com/in/cluelessog) with me!!.

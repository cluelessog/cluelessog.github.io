Good Day **Fellas**, I am **sourabh**

I always wanted to have a personal space online. This desire led me to create multiple blogs but I failed as my motivation to start was different back then. Recently I came across an awesome article about "[the great online game](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game?s=r)” by **Packy McCormick** that explains how we all are part of an online game.

With this shift in perspective I decided to be a part of the great online game and created this website. This website is a way for me to share some of my thoughts, ideas and stories and projects.

I currently work as as a **Software Engineer** at **Qualcomm, Hyderabad**.

**My Hobbies and Interests**

I love games and tinker with [code](https://github.com/cluelessog) from time-to-time. Here’s an interesting fact about me. I get bored really fast which is why I cycle through things I am interested in but I mostly end up picking two three things at a time. Yeah I am kinda messed up.

These days I am learning to be a better reader and writer and solve coding problems for kick **(green ticks)**. 

Apart from things mentioned above I love to read. This is a newly found hobby because I was never a reader. I read anything that I find interesting. I am currently reading Sapiens by Yuah noval harari.

I consider Naval Ravikant as my mentor because I have learned a lot from him. Don’t get surprised if you find me quoting him.

Thanks for stopping by. Have a good day. Feel free to [connect](https://linkedin.com/in/cluelessog) with me!!.

Finally, after putting it off for ages, I'm getting my thoughts down.  **Yay!!**

While growing up, figuring out happiness has been tough for me.

So, What is Happiness?
{{< /lead >}}
Well, I think happiness is feeling good without needing anything else. It's like when you're content with what you have. Wanting stuff all the time actually makes us unhappy. You know, like always wishing for this or that. The further away we are from getting what we want, the more unhappy we feel.

**But does that mean we shouldn't want anything at all?**
<br><br>I'd say no. It's totally fine to want things. But the key is to enjoy the journey of trying to get them. Because most of the time, we're working towards our goals.

This way of thinking has really helped me out, and I hope it helps you too.
